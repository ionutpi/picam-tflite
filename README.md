# Image Classification on Raspberry Pi Zero with TensorFlow Lite and Picamera

This code allows you to process images from a Raspberry Pi camera using a pretrained TensorFlow model.

The model is trained to count fingers in an image of a hand.

You can find how to train the model in my notebook on Kaggle:
